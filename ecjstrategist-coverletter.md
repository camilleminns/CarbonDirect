Dear Dr. Braneon: 

I’m writing to express my strong interest in the Environmental and Climate Justice Strategist position at Carbon Direct. I have long been impressed with Carbon Direct’s work with carbon removal and its more intentional efforts to advance equity in this sector.

The transition to cleaner technologies—whether carbon removal or renewable energy—is underway; the prioritization of justice throughout this process, however, is not. This is the role I intend to play in my career. I’m currently completing my M.S. in Environmental Policy and Planning, with a focus on environmental justice and renewable energy technologies, bringing a combination of academic knowledge and professional experience to the role. I have worked with non-profit organizations, private sector corporations, coalitions, and academia to ensure that frontline communities are represented in climate policy and planning.

One of the most meaningful projects I’ve been fortunate to be a part of is the co-creation of the “Environmental Justice in Tech (EJIT) Blueprint” and the related EJIT Principles through my work with EarthHacks. In this project, I facilitated conversations with multiple community activists and technologists to drive an environmental justice-focused culture shift in the technology space.

In my current position at Synapse Energy Economics, I’m conducting research and analysis of national energy programs and strategies, with a particular focus on identifying disparities and opportunities for energy equity considerations. I’m contributing to a final report that seeks to incorporate environmental and climate justice metrics into distributional equity analyses (DEAs), allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of relevant programs on vulnerable communities.

As someone born and raised in Nassau, Bahamas, I am particularly drawn to Carbon Direct's mission of reducing global carbon emissions and its recognition of the disproportionate effects of climate change on low-income countries. It would, therefore, be an honor to be a part of your team and contribute to this larger work.

Overall, I am confident that my skills and experience make me a valuable candidate for this position. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Sincerely,

Camille Minns
